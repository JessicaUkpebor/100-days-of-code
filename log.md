# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3rd August 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Used Javascript and HTML to build a random fact generator. Couldn't find the API I wanted so I added random facts to an array. Learnt about the Maths Floor function - although I still need a lot of practise so I'll be coming back to this - perhaps to build a word of the day generator using the Wordsnik API.

Also - my random fact generator didn't work the way I wanted it to, so I'll have to explore this part of Javascript further down the line.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Javascript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Going to come back to it later.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
