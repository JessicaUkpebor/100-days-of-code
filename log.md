# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4th August 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Used Javascript and HTML to build a random fact generator. Couldn't find the API I wanted so I added random facts to an array. Learnt about the Maths Floor function - although I still need a lot of practise so I'll be coming back to this - perhaps to build a word of the day generator using the Wordsnik API.

Also - my random fact generator didn't work the way I wanted it to, so I'll have to explore this part of Javascript further down the line.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Javascript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Going to come back to it later.

### Day 2: 5th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Basic CSS' module on Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts**: Used the course to refresh my memory on CSS, overall I'm very excited to use these new skils for styling.



### Day 3: 7th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 4 : 5th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discovered Frontend Mentor and I'm EXCITED! Finally found some projects that I can use to test my skills. I started their 'Single Price Grid Component' today.

**Thoughts** I'm not going to lie, as soon as I saw the challenges i panicked. It's one thing passively learning and it's another thing when it comes to putting what you've learnt to the test. With a bit of help from Google, part of my HTML and CSS knowledge were coming back to me.


### Day 5: 9th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: Submitted my solutuin to the challenge yesterday and it wasn't perfect. It was interesting to see how my solution differed from others. Nontheless I decided to perfect my solution today and I'm happier than ever. It is closer to the actual challenge and I'm super proud as it's my first time coding with 0 help.

**Thoughts** Leant a lot on CSS for this challenge. Patience is key too!
